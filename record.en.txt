Guide novice
Dear Commander, Congratulations on completing the training for the recruits. Let's talk about advanced knowledge.
Guide equipment supply
Commander, please bring along the equipment before entering the battle, and better protect the chariots and members in the battle!
Fire extinguishers can automatically extinguish the burning tank
First aid kit can treat injured members in combat
Repair box can repair all damaged modules at once
Now we are going to replenish supplies.
Ammunition guidance
Each tank can be loaded with different ammunition. Each ammunition has different characteristics. Letâ€™s take a look.
The choice of ammunition is extremely important in combat performance. Each type of ammunition has a corresponding armor piercing and damage range, and will not cause damage without penetrating armor.
Each chariot has the maximum ammunition loading. The sum of all kinds of ammunition cannot exceed the upper limit, so please choose the right ammunition with strategy. Note that the number on the right side of the icon on the left represents the armor of the current ammunition and the range of damage.
Boot battle mode
The game offers a rich combat mode, let's take a look
Standard mode, will match the player of the current tank level, experience reward after battle, etc.
Team mode, you can open black with friends

Please choose a tank that can be developed.

Medium tank, maneuvering better performance
Heavy tank, armor protection, the best amount of traffic
Choose and buy a chariot
Enhanced barrel
Commander, we can upgrade the barrel of the tank.
Develop a higher level of barrel, tank penetration and damage will be greatly improved

Injury to members will reduce the overall combat capability of the vehicle.
If the tank ammunition is hit with a fatal blow, it will explode and destroy the chariot.
Using supplies and consumables can help you fight better.
The first aid kit is used to treat all injured members immediately.
Destroying the engine or track of an enemy chariot will stop it from moving.
The vehicle has various modules, and the damaged module has reduced combat efficiency.
Damaged undamaged modules can continue to operate, but efficiency is reduced.
A damaged module will not function properly.
Damaged modules are automatically repaired, but they are damaged after repair and the combat efficiency is reduced.
All damaged modules will be repaired immediately using the repair tool.
Attacking the engine of an enemy chariot or destroying its fuel tank can cause the chariot to catch fire.
Team members will spend some time fighting fire.
Automatic fire extinguishing will be carried out automatically.
Vehicles that catch fire will continue to lose their health and will destroy the module and reduce the efficiency of their combat.
In order to prevent the enemy from occupying our base, it is necessary to cause damage to the enemy vehicles that are being occupied.
The more chariots that enter the flag-taking point, the faster the occupation.
